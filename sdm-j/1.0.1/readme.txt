The files in this directory collectively define the Service Description Model for JSON (SDM-J). The goal of the SDM-J is to provide a physical representation of the Service Description Conceptual Model (SDCM 2.0) <http://swim.aero/sdcm>.
The collection of JSON schemas presented in this directory follows the structure outlined in the SDCM.
 The 'service-description.json.' represents the top class in the SDCM, Service Description.
 The classes 'profile.json,' 'model.json,' and 'grounding.json' represent SCDM Profile, Model, and Grounding classes, respectively.
 The 'organization.json,' 'document.json,' and 'category.json' represent the abstract classes defined in the SDCM.
 The 'resource.json' schema captures the extension for REST Web services proposed by the FAA in May 2020.
